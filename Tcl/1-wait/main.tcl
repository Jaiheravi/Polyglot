# prints (3) while (2) finishes.
# Also `vwait forever` at the end is needed to keep the process running
# until `exit` is called, otherwise the program will exit
# before the `after` instruction has finished.

# Generate a random number between the provided
# `min` and `max` range
proc randomInRange {min max} {

# We need to call `exit` manually because we used `vwait forever`
# to keep the process running while `after` finishes.
# The `n` parameter is just for knowing the order of the call

    chan puts "--------------------------------------------------"

# The `after` function expects miliseconds, and we want to use seconds
# so we need to multiply and divide by 1000 for convenience
